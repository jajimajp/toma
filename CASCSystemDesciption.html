<H3>Architecture</H3>

Toma 0.4 is an automatic equational theorem prover. 
It proves unsatisfiability of a UEQ problem as follows: 
A given problem is transformed into a word problem whose validity entails 
unsatisfiability of the original problem. 
The word problem is solved by a new variant of maximal (ordered) completion 
[<A HREF="http://www.tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=WM18">WM18</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=Hir21">Hir21</A>].

<H3>Strategies</H3>

Toma performs ordered completion in the following way:
(1) Given an equational system E, the tool constructs a lexicographic path 
order > that maximizes reducibility of the ordered rewrite system (E, >) 
[<A HREF="http://www.tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=WM18">WM18</A>].
(2) Using the order >, the tool runs ordered completion 
[<A HREF="http://www.tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=BDP89">BDP89</A>] on E without the 
deduce rule (critical pair generation). 
Such a run eventually ends with an inter-reduced version (E', >).
(3) Then the tool checks joinability of the goal.
If the goal is joinable with respect to (E', >), the tool outputs the proof and terminates.
Otherwise, assigning the union of E' and a set of critical pairs of (E', >) 
to E, the tool goes back to the first step (1).
After a certain number of iterations of the loop,
the tool skips the order generation step (1) and repeats only (2)(3) with a fixed lexicographic path order.

<H3>Implementation</H3>

Toma is written in Haskell.
Z3 is used to solve maximization problems of reducibility.
The source code is available at:

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

Toma is still in the experimental stage and unable to compete with matured 
tools. The tool would solve several easy problems from the categories BOO, GRP and RNG.

(VAR x y z)
(RULES
a(cur(x),y) -> cur(a(x, p(one,a(y,up))))
a(p(x,y), z) -> p(a(x,z),a(y, z))
a(a(x, y), z) -> a(x, a(y, z))
a(i, x) -> x
a(one, i) -> one
a(up, i) -> up
a(one, p(x, y)) -> x
a(up, p(x, y)) -> y
)
(COMMENT
See TeReSe 6.5.42.
GWPO proofs require mix interpretation (max and polyonominals)?
